1819,,TRUE,echapin@sheltonschools.org,Whole class,,Somewhat comfortable,"typing in a web page is hard for 3rd graders, and we struggled a bit to navigate the drop down menus, but otherwise it was very smooth. ",CORE,The CORE system seems like it would give me a more holistic view of their fluency capabilities due to there being multiple passages and more time for them to actually complete the reading.  ,,
1819,,TRUE,heidi.pratt@springfield.k12.or.us,Whole class,Next time I will test in small groups.  It was too loud as a whole group.  It was somewhat uncomfortable for students that were reading out loud all by themselves.,Somewhat comfortable,The students that ended up reading alone at the end of the testing session were a little bit uncomfortable.  I think I could have set that up better with kids and I will make changes the next time we test.,CORE,"I think both are necessary, but I think the CORE system would be a good substitute for progress monitoring oral reading fluency.",,

It was difficult for some student will how loud it got.",It can get rather loud doing the study as a class and it seemed there was not enough directions on the computer for the students.  I wasn't sure if the passages were timed but it would be nice to set a time limit so some students are taking a long time to complete the assessment.,

I love the idea of the new system, however I would want to compare data to see how accurate the scoring is before giving a final answer.","I forgot that one student accidentally clicked the opt out button just before testing and I was too frazzled to figure out if that was fixable or not, so he did not participate in the testing process.",1

1819,,TRUE,Shannon.swift@district6.org,Whole class,,Somewhat comfortable,"I had a couple of students who struggled to follow directions, but most navigated fine. I had 2 students who were testing long after the others were done and both were teary-eyed and frustrated, so I had them stop. I think this was a combination of not following directions and being frustrated because the reading was challenging for them. ",CORE,"Honestly, I'm a little torn. I like that this system allows for multiple tries where as our current, traditional fluency assessment only gives them one shot. It also seems like there is less room for human error & biased. However, it can be overwhelming for kiddos who struggle with reading and particularly who are shy/uncomfortable reading out loud. ",Thank you for including us! ,
