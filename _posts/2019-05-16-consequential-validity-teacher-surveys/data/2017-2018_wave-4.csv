How many signed parent opt-outs did you receive?",Would you be willing to participate in this same study next school year?,"Thinking about your experience during this study, and the experiences of your students, how could the study be improved for teachers next year? That is, separate from the idea of computerized oral reading fluency assessment, what changes might improve the study for teacher and student participants?"
