First, have the child read the passage all the way through, while timing to get the WCPM.
Secondly, as per CCSS, a familiar passage, have the child read it a second time to score for fluency. This measure is especially important since some children will never even speak as fast as the benchmarking scores, allowing the assessor (who knows the child) to note if it is conversational and natural for each student.
Too often children whose speech cadence is a bit slow are placed in Rti groups because they speak slowly, but their reading is natural for them. 
To establish the natural speech pattern, students should then give a brief retell of what they read. This could be an additional assessment for comprehension."
