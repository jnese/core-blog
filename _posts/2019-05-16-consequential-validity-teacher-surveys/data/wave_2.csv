It is a valuable screener,Yes,We have an assessment sweep that does the ORF one on one and we use the results,No,I believe that it is a valuable thing to hear students read to a person.,I would rather do the ORF assessments with my own students.  We have sweep assessments but I don't like that a well.  I want to hear my students read to me not to someone else or to a computer.  My personal opinion.,,,

This year the district decide to use one team to administer the fluency test to increase validity and consistency,No,"I guess it depends on the number of students you have. With a team administering the ORF it doesn't impact the learning in the classroom as much. When I used to administer the ORF with 30 students, it was time consuming, so we had to be creative",It is helpful to hear for yourself where the students are struggling with fluency,,,
1718,12/11/2017 15:30,TRUE,echapin@sheltonschools.org,Yes,I is useful for my teaching because I find that their ORF scores coincide with their ability to grasp more complex text.

I do progress monitoring in class as an informal assessment to see how things are going",Yes,yes! it seems like it takes forever. Kids get nervous having the whole class quietly working because then they are being heard by their peers. It takes up a long period of time,"there is less error (on my end) when I do the traditional, I don't know how accurate these scores are to my students, but it seems like technology can be a pain sometimes and cause problems",,,

While I don't believe a one minute timed test is necessarily age appropriate for all students it takes a lot less time than the new test. The new oral test takes too long and is too difficult for many of my students. I'm not sure why they  have to continue reading so many stories.,,,

1718,12/7/2017 7:56,TRUE,samantha.beach@slane.k12.or.us,Yes,A lot of students are missing words with specific phonics patterns and an oral reading assessment helps to narrow our focus of what still needs to be taught. It is also helpful to identify students who struggle with fluency so that we can further practice. ,Yes,We do EasyCBM testing which includes a passage reading fluency. This helps us group students based on their reading level and track their progress with fluency. We also give vocabulary and comprehension tests to assess those skills.,No,Not with our current system. We break our students into small groups for about 45 minutes a day. We run stations and on testing days the stations are independent so we can pull students to read one-on-one. ,,,,

",No,"We have aides who administer benchmark testing, but I do progress monitor kiddos throughout the year. ",No,EasyCBM has a great online portal so I can input scores quickly as kids are reading. ,"I think the biggest downfalls at this point are 1) different people administering allows room for human error and 2) our program only gives ONE 1-minute assessment, which is such a small picture of student skill/growth.",,,

In some grades the benchmarks are unrealistic. I challenge anyone to read naturally at 168 per minute (5th grade benchmark), and still sound natural.
