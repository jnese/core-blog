## Introduction

We examined the differences in passage length for words correct per minute (WCPM) scores of curriculum-based measurement of oral reading fluency (CBM-R). The four `passage lengths` were: (1) `easyCBM` passages as traditional CBM-R passages of about 250 words read for 60 seconds; and **CORE** passages read in their entirety that were (2) `long`, about 85 words, (3) `medium`, about 50 words, and (4) `short`, about 25 words. We also explored the effect of `scoring method` using: (1) *Traditional* - the real-time human scores, akin to traditional CBM-R assessments in schools; (2) *ASR* - automatic speech recogntion scores; and (3) *Recording* - the criterion measure, where recorded audio files were scored by human assessors in a private space wearing headsets (with the ability to rewind, replay, and adjust audio). Results for effects of `scoring methods` can be found [here](https://jnese.github.io/core-blog/posts/2019-04-16-asr-can-score-cbmr-assessments/).

These results are part of our larger **Content & Convergent Evidence Study**. For details about the Content & Convergent Evidence Study procedures, including information on the sample, CBM-R passages, administration, and scoring methods, go [here](https://jnese.github.io/core-blog/posts/2019-04-04-content-convergent-evidence-study-procedures/).

## Summary

When using ASR scoring – [as previously established is acceptable](https://jnese.github.io/core-blog/posts/2019-04-16-asr-can-score-cbmr-assessments/) – there are no statistically significant differences in WCPM based on `passage length`, suggesting that the WCPM scores of the shorter **CORE** passages are generally comparable to the scores on  traditional CBM-R passages. These findings provide preliminary evidence that shorter passages can be administered in schools as part of CBM-R assessment practrices. 

This finding has the potential to make a sizable contribution to the field under the idea that traditional CBM-R administration can be made even briefer (e.g., 30 seconds), saving time and resources. 

Using multiple shorter CBM-R passages also has the potential the increase the reliability and reduce the standard error of WCPM scores, much like increasing the number of items on a test increases the reliability properties of the test. Increased reliability of CBM-R scores would provide educators with more accurate scores with which to monitor student CBM-R progress over time, and thus increase the consequential validity of the decisions based on those scores.

## Analysis

We applied a mixed-effects model for **WCPM** scores separately for each of Grades 2 through 4, with random effects for `students` and `passages`, and fixed effects for `passage length` (four levels: *easyCBM*, *short*, *medium*, and *long*), `scoring method` (three levels: *ASR*, *Recording*, and *Traditional*), and their interaction `passage length:scoring method`.

```

Based on the model's results, we calculated pairwise comparisons from the estimated marginal means to examine the effects of `passage length`.

The figure below shows the estimated marginal WCPM means for each `passage length` by grade and `scoring method`. The 95% confidence intervals for all comparisons overlap, suggestig that the estimated WCPM scores across `passage length` are relatively comparable. 

```{r layout="l-body-outset"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig_est_means_pssglngth_blog.png")
```

To assist the interpretation of the results of the final model, we also report the statistical significance of the differences in marginal means, as well as Cohen’s (1988) *d* effect size estimates in the table below.

None of the pairwise comparisons (across grades and scoring methods) between the **CORE** passages (`long`, `medium`, and `short`) and traditional `easyCBM` passages were statistically significant at the *p* = .01 level, except for two *Recording* criteria WCPM scores (Grade 2 `easyCBM-long` and `easyCBM-short`), and one *Traditional* WCPM score for Grade 4 `long-short`. 

An examination of the magnitude of the effect sizes across all scoring methods showed that the largest absolute differences were between the `easyCBM` and `short` or `medium` length passages. The smallest absolute differences were between the `long` and `medium` length passages for Grades 2 and 3, and between the `medium` and `short` in Grade 4.


In general, the estimated mean WCPM differences and effect sizes are larger when comparing `easyCBM` passages to **CORE** passages. But while the effect size differences increased across Grades 2 to 3 to 4, the opposite pattern was observed for the estimated differences, because the *SE* remained relatively stable across grades (for the pairwise comparison estimates and *d*).

Importantly, the *ASR* results (top of the table below) provide evidence that when using *ASR* scoring there were no statistically significant differences in WCPM based on `passage length`.

Thus, the scores the shorter **CORE** passages were generally comparable to the scores on the traditional `easyCBM` passages.
