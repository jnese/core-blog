"Yes, I give my consent to participate in this study.","The student is reading significantly below grade level.  We expect some summer regression, but 73 wpm would lead me to believe that the students may have some gaps in phonics and decoding.",Below grade level,Not enough information (Please specify what other data would you like to see for this student),"Was the student uncomfortable, testing with an unfamiliar adult, new school? I would want more formative assessments to see if this one assessment was a true indicator of performance.",Black,Both lines show outliers in the passages students were reading. You can see that the two students both had dips on the same passages. The black line is more accurate for creating a student aim line.,Black,"While the yellow student shows more growth, the black line is more consistent therefore more trustworthy.",It appears the intervention is working for the student,Student has made significant growth. This would be a very successful intervention.,I cannot tell whether the intervention is working or not,I would need more than three data points to tell whether the intervention is working.  The student could have just had an off day in December or the passage could have been significantly easier in March.,Black,I don't know,I don't know,I am very unfamiliar with this concept,No,Black,Smaller room for error based on the grey measurement error.,Yes,It could help determine students outlier scores and make with the reliability of progress monitoring.,Below level,Below grade level,Not enough information (Please specify what other data would you like to see for this student),"Would need to know whether student is receiving intervention, on an IEP, attendance, etc.",Black,Students trend line is more consistent. They are making continuous growth.,Black,The line follows a common trend.,I cannot tell whether the intervention is working or not,Student's progress monitoring scores are all over the map.,It appears the intervention is working for the student,Continuous upward trend.,Yellow,Yellow,No difference between the two lines,Black,"Smaller error measurement, more consistent trend.",Yes,This could be used to tell whether an intervention is working for a student. If the intervention is successful the error measurement would be smaller. Would help eliminate the outside factors when progress monitoring a student.,Below level.,Below grade level,Not enough information (Please specify what other data would you like to see for this student),"Attendance, previous interventions, IEP?, is the student new to the school",No difference between the two lines,The first score for the yellow student is clearly an outlier and should be included when looking at their aim line.  The other progress monitoring points are fairly consistent with growth. The black line student line is consistent but shows minimal growth over the course of a school year.,No difference between the two lines,See notes above.,It appears the intervention is working for the student,Student is making adequate growth for the year with the exception of one outlier progress monitoring point.,It appears the intervention is NOT working for the student,While the student's score is consistent and making slow progress the intervention isn't making the 2.5 word growth goal per week.  The student should be making more progress more quickly.,Yellow,Yellow,I don't know,Black,Consistency and aim line.,Yes,NA,Below level.,Below grade level,Not enough information (Please specify what other data would you like to see for this student),"Attendance, previous interventions, IEP?",No difference between the two lines,Both lines show consistent trends. The yellow is a positive trend with a student following an upward aim line and the black a downward aim line. The June progress monitoring data point is clearly an outlier and should be excluded. The passage may have been more complex or included information that student didn't understand.,No difference between the two lines,See above.,It appears the intervention is working for the student,"Student is making significant adequate progress towards end of the year growth, despite the data point from June.",It appears the intervention is NOT working for the student,Student is not making adequate growth and another intervention should be considered.,No difference between the two lines,No difference between the two lines,No difference between the two lines,No difference between the two lines,"Both lines are showing consistent trends if you remove the data point from June.  The Yellow line student is trending upwards and you can create their aim line based off those 3 data points.  The Black line student has a consistent trend as well, although it's trending downward.",Yes,NA
"Yes, I give my consent to participate in this study.",This ORF score would indicate that the student is likely reading below grade level.,Below grade level,Yes,NA,Yellow,"While both lines have some wide swings in performance, the yellow line seems to indicate overall progress and effective interventions.",Yellow,"The Yellow line indicates that although the May score fell from the March score significantly, there was progress made through the course of the  year.",It appears the intervention is working for the student,Higher word count per minute each assessment.,It appears the intervention is working for the student,The March score shows a significant improvement from the October score.,Yellow,Yellow,Black,I am a little unfamiliar with this concept,Yes,Black,It has less measurement error.,Yes,"I might use it to adjust my interventions, or to check the integrity of my assessments.",This student is at risk based on this score.,Below grade level,Yes,NA,Black,It shows a steady increase in scores.,Black,The increases are steady.,I cannot tell whether the intervention is working or not,There are wide swings in the data points.,It appears the intervention is working for the student,There seems to be steady progress.,I don't know,Black,Black,Black,There appears to be less measurement error.,Yes,I can use it to determine the nature of interventions and the consistency of assessments.,This student is at risk.,Below grade level,Yes,NA,I don't know,"steady, consistent scores, without wide fluctuations.",Black,Steady growth without wide performance swings.,I cannot tell whether the intervention is working or not,"There appears to be growth at first, but it is not maintained.",It appears the intervention is working for the student,Steady growth without wide swings in performance,Black,Black,Black,Black,Less gray area,Yes,To evaluate the effectiveness of my interventions.,This student is at risk.,Below grade level,Yes,NA,Yellow,It shows growth.,I don't know,"It depends on the interventions given, and other factors in the student's life.",It appears the intervention is working for the student,The student shows growth in performance.,It appears the intervention is NOT working for the student,Performance on assessments is decreasing.,Yellow,Yellow,Yellow,Black,Less gray,Yes,Consider other interventions
"Yes, I give my consent to participate in this study.","A oral reading fluency score of 73 tells me that this students may be a slower reader. They may be taking time to sound out words, or maybe not recognizing sight words as quickly as they should. With a fluency rate of 73 this student will need additional time to read grade level content material.",Below grade level,Not enough information (Please specify what other data would you like to see for this student),Comprehension scores,Black,This line shows more of a steady progression.,Black,The black line shows more consistency.,It appears the intervention is working for the student,The line is showing a significant improvement in the reading skill the intervention is addressing.,It appears the intervention is working for the student,The first point is the initial score. The second point looks to me like the intervention is just beginning and the third point shows the increase in skill once the student has been participating in the intervention over time.,Black,Yellow,Black,I am a little familiar with this concept,No,Black,The yellow line is too extreme.,Yes,Based off of this data I could determine if the student needed an intervention program focused on oral reading fluency skills.,"This student has emerging reading skills. Although their reading fluency score is lower than I would hope it to be, I could infer that this student is just a slower reader. I really like to see comprehension data along with the fluency scores because I like to know if the student is perhaps reading a bit slower because they're are focused on comprehending what they read. I would also like to see the students accuracy scores. It is a big difference if the student has a low score with 100% accuracy versus a student with a low score due to several errors.",At grade level,Not enough information (Please specify what other data would you like to see for this student),See above,Black,Shows a steady line.,Black,Consistent,It appears the intervention is working for the student,A drop in the beginning of the program but then a steady incline once the program is established.,It appears the intervention is working for the student,The student is making steady progress,Black,Black,Black,Black,NA,Yes,NA,Please see previous response for additional information needed.,At grade level,Yes,NA,Black,NA,Black,NA,It appears the intervention is working for the student,NA,It appears the intervention is NOT working for the student,The line is not showing a significant improvement in the reading skill. With an intervention program you should see the trajectory of the line increasing faster.,Black,Black,Black,Yellow,The drastic change of the line shows me where the student is struggling.,Yes,NA,The student seems to be reading at a lower level.
