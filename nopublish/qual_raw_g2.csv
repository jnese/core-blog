"Yes, I give my consent to participate in this study.",This student is below grade level.  We want students coming in to second grade in the fall at around 63 cwpm to be at the 50th %ile or above.  This students falls under the 25th percentile.,Below grade level,Yes,NA,I don't know,"I don't understand what you mean by ""better for progress monitoring.""  Are you asking which student would better qualify for progress monitoring?  Or which line looks like more accurate progress monitoring?  I would definitely consider the May score on the yellow line to be an outlier and would reassess this student on 3 different passages.",Black,"It looks like more typical growth because of the last data point on the yellow line.  Although, it is also very normal to see students go up and down depending on the passage.",I cannot tell whether the intervention is working or not,"For a student this low, they would probably need to be progress monitored at a first grade level.  We'd want to see bi-weekly data points to see if they're making progress at their instructional level.  Progress on a second grade level passage may not be visible even though an intervention is working because the second grade passage is still too difficult.",It appears the intervention is working for the student,"They increased from 18 to 33, so I assume it's working, but again I'd want to see more information and data points at their instructional level before making this assumption.",I am a little unfamiliar with this concept,Yes,Black,NA,Yes,You might be able to trust the last number on the yellow line a little more if you assume that the margin of error shows they could actually have been quite a bit higher in November.,This students is below grade level and coming into second grade below the 25th percentile.,Below grade level,Yes,NA,I don't know,"Again, not understanding what this question is asking.  The yellow line is what we typically see as students go up and down based on passages.",I don't know,"Either of these lines could represent a typical student.  Ideally, they'd all show growth like the black line, but that's not reality.",It appears the intervention is working for the student,"They ended higher than they were.   Again, I'd like to see a lot more data points between Nov-Mar to make this decision.",It appears the intervention is working for the student,It shows a steady increase in their ORF.,Black,It shows less margin of error.,Yes,"The yellow line shows a lot more room for measurement error, so you'd have to take those scores with a grain of salt.",This student is coming in below the 25th percentile in the fall of 2nd grade.,Below grade level,Yes,NA,I don't know,I don't understand what the question is asking.,No difference between the two lines,They follow a similar pattern.,It appears the intervention is working for the student,They are showing a lot of growth in ORF from Oct-Mar.,I cannot tell whether the intervention is working or not,"If I'm ignoring the last data point, I'd want to see at least one other data point near the 67 cwpm mark from March before deciding whether the intervention was working.",Black,Less margin of error.,Yes,NA,This student is far below grade level coming into second grade.,Below grade level,Yes,NA,I don't know,NA,Black,It shows more typical growth without the large spike that the yellow line has.,I cannot tell whether the intervention is working or not,That last data point being so much higher than the first two makes me think there was an error.  I would want more data to tell whether the intervention was working or not.,It appears the intervention is working for the student,It shows realistic growth.,Black,Less room for measurement error.,Yes,I would trust the black line more.
"Yes, I give my consent to participate in this study.","Based on this score alone I would said this student is reading below grade level, HOWEVER I occasionally have a student who reads slowly (below grade level in ORF) yet has great comprehension and does not fit into any of our reading intervention programs. It is also fairly typical for kids to come into fall a little low after having the summer off.",Below grade level,Yes,NA,Black,It has a more steady and realistic incline. The yellow line does a lot of bouncing around. I don't typicall trust a huge outlying score (like the 87) until I have seen several more scores like it.,Black,"The black line shows steady growth, wich is probably more realistic of improvement.",I cannot tell whether the intervention is working or not,"The student seems to be progressing in an upward trend. BUT, since the student is bouncing up and down, I would need to see more data points showing growth. Otherwise, moving from 21 to 28 WPM is not adequate growth.",It appears the intervention is working for the student,"The black line shows steady growth in an upward trend with bouncing up and down. Although this nowhere near the amount of growth I would like to see from this student in this amount of time, this tells me the student is steadily progressing/showing growth. I would hope to see more date points in that amount of time (we progress monitor student receiving interventions every two weeks). I would also like to see student accuracy. For a student who started out reading so low, it would be important to me that their accuracy is improving, even if their fluency isn't making huge gains.",I am a little familiar with this concept,Yes,Black,It has a lower margin or error and is likely shows a truer picture of the student's actual progress.,Yes,"Recognizing the measurement error could help me decide whether to keep each student in his/her current intervention or change to a new intervention. At some point, it could also help me to decide whether to move a student out of interventions altogether.","This student's score is below the fall target for second graders. Although it is possible that this student is coming out of summer and will pop back up, this student will likely need/benefit from interventions.",Below grade level,Yes,NA,Black,"It shows steady growth without outlying data points. However, if you're asking which ""looks"" better, I suppose yellow, because it is ultimately higher.",Black,The growth is more steady.,I cannot tell whether the intervention is working or not,"While the third data point looks really good, it is not super trustworthy on its own after the prior data point that was so low. I would need to see more data points showing a continuation of the upward trend before I would trust the growth.",It appears the intervention is working for the student,This student appears to be making steady growth with no outlying data points.,Black,It has a smaller margin of error. It shows a more steady growth pattern.,Yes,"With the shaded area, I can see that the student represented by the black line is making steady growth and the data points are likely more trustworthy.",This student is reading below the fall benchmark target and will likely need/benefit from interventions.,Below grade level,Yes,NA,No difference between the two lines,Both lines show a pretty rapid rate of growth with one outlier date point.,No difference between the two lines,Both lines show a pretty rapid rate of growth with one outlier date point.,It appears the intervention is working for the student,"This student appears to be making great growth. All date points are showing growth. BUT, I would still love to see more data points to see this student maintaining the growth, as well as accuracy.",It appears the intervention is working for the student,"This student appears to be making great growth, although the number of data points is limited!",Black,"According to the line, it has a smaller margin of error.",Yes,"According to the shaded area, the student in yellow might need to continue to demonstrate growth with additional data points, while the student in black is successfully demonstrating similar growth.",This student is pretty significantly below the fall target for second grade. He/she would be placed into an intervention.,Below grade level,Yes,NA,Black,The growth is more steady and reliable and the final data point is higher than the yellow.,Black,It has no outlying data points like the yellow line does.,I cannot tell whether the intervention is working or not,"This student appears to be showing miraculous growth, however, I wouldn't trust this data without additional data points supporting/proving the steady growth.",It appears the intervention is working for the student,"This student appears to be making steady, realistic growth with now crazy outlying data points.",Black,It has a much smaller margin of error.,Yes,"I would question the success of the intervention program for the student in yellow, according to the shaded area. The student represented by the black line, however, appears to be making steady progress, which would tell me their intervention program is working."
"Yes, I give my consent to participate in this study.","In my class, I would have not placed this student in an intervention group for this score alone. Nevertheless, this is also a score that would have caused me to take note of this student.",Below grade level,Not enough information (Please specify what other data would you like to see for this student),Reading Fluency,No difference between the two lines,"They both show me WCPM, I have seen both types of progress in my students.",Black,Typically students show a steady progress rather that a sudden increase (shown in yellow).,I cannot tell whether the intervention is working or not,The data points are close together and there is some reading regression from time to time.,It appears the intervention is working for the student,"There is a steady increase in WCPM,",I am a little familiar with this concept,Yes,Black,There appears to be little to no measurement error.,Yes,"If I received information that looked like the yellow line, I might attempt to figure out why the student is only achieving what the data shows. Maybe they are distracted or confused about testing process.","I would want to say they were below grade level, but I wouldn't have enough information to know what support to give them.",Below grade level,Not enough information (Please specify what other data would you like to see for this student),"Reading Fluency, Oral samples",Black,They show progress coming back from summer and then level off at the end of the school year. This seems typical of many students.,Black,This trajectory is common for the majority of my students.,I cannot tell whether the intervention is working or not,The data points are all over.,It appears the intervention is working for the student,There is a constant growth demonstrated throughout the year.,Black,"There is little measurement error, it seems more trustworthy.",Yes,"For the yellow line, it suggests that there is high error in the measurement.","The student is probably below grade level, but I don't know what services to offer the student based on that score alone.",Below grade level,Not enough information (Please specify what other data would you like to see for this student),"Reading Fluency, Oral Samples",No difference between the two lines,They both show typical student data.,No difference between the two lines,I am used to seeing data represented in both student samples.,It appears the intervention is working for the student,There is a steady increase in student achievement.,It appears the intervention is working for the student,There is very little regression and then student achievement is demonstrated.,Black,"The shaded area is small, this suggests there is little measurement error.",Yes,I would think the black line shows accurate data for the student where the yellow line shows some measurement error.,"Student seems to be below grade level, however I do not have enough data to make an informed decision about supports for the student.",Below grade level,Not enough information (Please specify what other data would you like to see for this student),"Reading Fluency, Oral Sample",Black,The data seems more indicative of student progress.,Black,The data is consistent.,It appears the intervention is working for the student,There is a large increase in student ability at the third point.,It appears the intervention is working for the student,There is a steady performance increase throughout the three data points.,Black,The grey area indicates little measurement error.,Yes,It indicates little measurement error in the black line and a larger amount of error for the yellow line.
